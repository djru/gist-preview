#Gist Preview

[Gist Preview](http://gist-preview.herokuapp.com/) is a web service that takes a URL for a raw HTML [gist](https://gist.github.com), and renders it. For whatever reason, Github currently does not support this feature, so I went ahead and developed a workaround.

##To Do
	- Allow users to get shortened, sharable URLs rendered gists (eg. "http://gist-preview.herokuapp.com/abc123" instead of "http://gist-preview.herokuapp.com/preview?gist_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist.githubusercontent.com%2Forzogen%2F8233334%2Fraw%2Ffacc3b0e81cd3e8b5035db4bb3292e524f49be56%2Fhello.html")
	- Create Chrome extension that allows users to view the rendered version of their gist with one key command.
